# 🧪 VirtualChemLab

**VirtualChemLab** is a simple web-based project that aims to simulate a **virtual chemistry lab** where users can perform basic qualitative inorganic analysis experiments.

Right now, the project is in its **early development stage** — setting up the frontend, backend, and core logic.

---

## 🚧 Current Status

* Basic project setup (frontend + backend)
* Initial UI design and file structure
* Working towards adding simple reactions and observations

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Database:** MySQL (for storing reactions and logic)

---

## 🧠 Goal

To let users test an unknown salt sample with virtual reagents, observe realistic outcomes (like color change or precipitate), and identify the ions — just like in a real chemistry lab.

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualChemLab.git

# Move into project folder
cd VirtualChemLab

# Run backend
python app.py

# Run frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**
